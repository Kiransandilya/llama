In the simplest case, the only difference between a classical and a quantum computer is a quantum computer has more qubits than a classical computer. However, that’s not the whole story.\\nThe important thing to understand is how a quantum computer is different than a classical computer. The main difference is that quantum computers can use quantum bits (qubits) instead of bits. A qubit can hold both 0 and 1. You could think of it as a bit that can be either 0 or 1 or both at the same time. A quantum computer is just a computer made up of qubits instead of bits.\\nQuantum computers have a lot of useful features that make them better at solving problems than classical computers. The first is that quantum computers can solve problems that are infeasible for classical computers. This is a big deal because a lot of interesting problems are difficult to solve. For example, it’s infeasible to solve the traveling salesman problem with a classical computer. The second feature is that quantum computers are inherently parallel.']"

This guide will show you how I have set up my computer and give you some guidelines for setting up your own linux computer.\\nBefore we begin, it is very important to understand the differences between a linux computer and a windows computer. The main difference is that windows is a program that is designed to be used by a user, whereas linux is a program designed to be used by a computer. So, for example, when you click on the start menu in windows, it means different things depending on what program you have selected. But in linux, it always means \"Open a program\", which is great because the programs are all grouped together in one menu.\\nAnother difference is that you have to be logged into the computer before it will do anything for you. This makes it a lot more secure, because you have to enter a password to start the computer. You can also configure different users, and set which programs they have access to.\\nA final difference is that linux is a lot more stable than windows.
