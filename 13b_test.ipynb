      "[\"what are some good programming languages for beginners?\\nThere are several programming languages that are well-suited for beginners. Here are some popular options:\\n\\n1. Python: Python is a high-level language that is easy to read and write, making it a great language for beginners. It has a simple syntax and is often used in introductory programming courses. Python is also a versatile language, meaning that it can be used for a wide range of applications, such as web development, data analysis, and machine learning.\\n2. JavaScript: JavaScript is a popular language for web development and is used by millions of websites around the world. It's a client-side language, which means that it runs on the user's web browser, rather than on the server. JavaScript is also used in mobile app development, game development, and server-side programming.\\n3. Scratch: Scratch is a visual programming language that is designed specifically for beginners, especially children. It uses a block-based syntax, where users can create programs by dragging and dropping blocks of code, rather than typing them out. Scratch is great for learning the basics of programming, such as loops, variables, and conditionals.\\n4. Ruby: Ruby is a high-level language that is known for its simplicity and readability. It's a great language for beginners who want to learn good coding practices and paradigms. Ruby is also used in web development and has a large community of developers who contribute to its ecosystem.\\n5. Swift: Swift is a relatively new language developed by Apple for developing iOS and macOS apps. It's designed to give developers more freedom to create powerful, modern apps with a clean and easy-to-read syntax. Swift is also open-source, which means that developers can contribute to its development and improvement.\\n6. Java: Java is an object-oriented language that is\"]\n"

Open a new file in your favorite text editor and save it with a `.py` extension (e.g. `hello_world.py`).\\n2. Write the following code in the file:\\n```\\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\\n```\\n3. Save the file and run it using the Python interpreter (e.g. `python hello_world.py`).\\nWhat to Expect\\n---------------\\n\\nWhen you run the program, you should see the following output:\\n```\\nHello, World!\\n\\n```\\nConclusion\\n==========\\n\\nCongratulations! You have just written and run your first Python program. You have learned how to use the `print()` function to output text to the console. Keep practicing and experimenting with Python to learn more about this powerful programming language.']\n"
